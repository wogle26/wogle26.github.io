## What Is Asylum?

Asylum is a legal protection for individuals who are physically present in the United States and fear returning to their home country due to persecution based on:

- Race
- Religion
- Nationality
- Political opinion
- Membership in a particular social group

If granted asylum, you may remain in the U.S., apply for a green card after one year, and request to bring certain family members.

## Who Can Apply?

You may apply for asylum if:

- You are currently inside the United States, regardless of how you entered
- You file your application within **one year** of your last arrival (some exceptions apply)
- You are not barred for certain reasons (such as serious criminal history or previous denials)

You do **not** need to have entered the U.S. legally to apply for asylum.
