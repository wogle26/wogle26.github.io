## Why This Matters

For many immigrants, sending money to family abroad is more than a financial act — it’s a lifeline. But remittances come with hidden legal and financial risks that most senders aren’t warned about. This guide explains how to send money securely, avoid scams, and protect yourself legally — even if you don’t have legal immigration status.

## What Counts as a Remittance?

A **remittance** is any cross-border transfer of money from the U.S. to another country. Most remittances are:

- Sent by individuals (not businesses)
- Intended to support family or cover essential expenses
- Handled by transfer companies or digital platforms

If you're sending money regularly, the law considers this a **financial activity** — and certain rules may apply.

## Your Legal Rights When Sending Money

Even if you are undocumented, you still have **consumer rights** under U.S. law:

- **Error Resolution**: You have the right to dispute errors or delays.
- **Clear Disclosures**: Transfer services must show the exchange rate, total fees, and amount received — before you pay.
- **Receipt Required**: You must be given a written receipt that includes your cancellation and refund rights.

These protections come from the **Remittance Rule** under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

## Do You Need to Have Papers?

No. You do **not** need a Social Security number or lawful immigration status to send money legally.

However:

- Many services will require a **valid ID** (foreign passport, consular ID, etc.).
- Transfers over **$1,000** may trigger extra identity checks.
- Transfers over **$10,000** may be reported to the IRS or flagged under the **Bank Secrecy Act**.

Keep all receipts and consider using services that accept ITINs or foreign IDs.

## Avoiding Fraud and Exploitation

Immigrants are frequent targets for remittance scams. Protect yourself:

- Never send money to strangers, no matter who they claim to be.
- Avoid unregulated kiosks or suspicious promotions.
- Use licensed services registered with FinCEN or your state’s regulator.

If your money is lost or stolen, file a complaint with the **CFPB** or your **state attorney general**.

## Tax and Legal Considerations

Remittances are not taxable in most cases, but large or frequent transfers may raise flags:

- Transfers over $10,000 in one or related transactions must be reported.
- Large, repeated transfers may be viewed as income or support abroad.
- Receipts can help prove family ties, support, or good moral character during legal status applications.

**Tip**: Keep a basic record of all remittances: dates, amounts, recipients, and reasons.

## Best Practices for Safe Transfers

- Use **regulated services** (e.g., Remitly, Xoom, Wise)
- **Avoid cash** when possible; digital trails protect you
- Use a **consistent name and ID** across transfers
- **Keep all receipts** and confirmation numbers
- **Verify recipient names** exactly as they appear on ID

## If Something Goes Wrong

If your money was lost, delayed, or misused:

1. Contact the transfer company directly.
2. File a complaint with the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/)
3. Contact your **state consumer protection office**
4. Reach out to local legal aid or advocacy groups for help
