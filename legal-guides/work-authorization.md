## What Is an EAD?

An **Employment Authorization Document (EAD)**, also known as a work permit, allows certain non-citizens to legally work in the United States. It is not automatic — you must apply for it using the correct form and evidence.

---

## Who Can Apply?

You may qualify if you are:
- An asylum applicant (150 days after filing I-589)
- In Temporary Protected Status (TPS)
- Applying for Adjustment of Status (green card)
- A DACA recipient
- Awaiting certain court decisions

Each category has different rules — always check the current USCIS eligibility list.
