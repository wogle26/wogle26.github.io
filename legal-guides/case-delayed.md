## What Counts as a Delay?

Immigration applications can take months or even years to process. A delay becomes a concern when your case:
- Exceeds the normal processing time  
- Has no updates for many months  
- Shows no progress on the USCIS or EOIR case tracker

---

## Step-by-Step: How to Follow Up

1. **Check Current Processing Times**
   - Use the [USCIS Processing Time Tool](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/)
   - Compare with your form, location, and service center

2. **Use the USCIS Case Status Tracker**
   - Visit: [uscis.gov/casestatus](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/)
   - Enter your receipt number to see updates

3. **Submit an Online Inquiry**
   - Use the [USCIS Case Inquiry Tool](https://egov.uscis.gov/e-request/displayONPTForm.do) if your case is outside normal time

4. **Call USCIS or EOIR**
   - USCIS Customer Service: 1-800-375-5283  
   - EOIR Case Info: 1-800-898-7180

5. **Contact Your U.S. Congressperson**
   - Many elected officials have a casework department that can request updates for you

6. **Consider a Mandamus Lawsuit** (last resort)
   - For extreme delays, you may file a federal lawsuit to compel a decision  
   - Always consult a licensed immigration attorney before pursuing legal action

## When Not to Worry

- If your case is still **within published processing times**
- If you recently submitted documents or attended an interview (some delay is normal afterward)
