## What Is a Notice to Appear?

A Notice to Appear (NTA) is a legal document that tells you the U.S. government is starting removal (deportation) proceedings against you. It will include:

- Your name and A-number (alien registration number)
- The alleged reason why the government believes you should be removed
- A list of charges under immigration law
- A command to appear before an immigration judge at a future date

If you receive an NTA, it means you are being placed into immigration court. **It does not mean you are already deported.**

## What You Should Do Immediately

1. **Read the NTA Carefully**  
   - Check the personal information: your name, A-number, country of birth, and the reason for removal.
   - Look at the bottom for a court date or a line that says, “To be set.”

2. **Keep the NTA in a Safe Place**  
   - This is a formal legal document. Losing it can delay or harm your case.

3. **Get Legal Help as Soon as Possible**  
   - Find a qualified immigration attorney or nonprofit legal aid group.
   - Avoid “notarios” or people who offer legal help without a license.

4. **Check if You Have a Court Date Scheduled**  
   - If the NTA says “TBD” or “To Be Set,” your hearing may not be scheduled yet.
   - Use the [EOIR Automated Case Information System](https://acis.eoir.justice.gov/en/) to check:
     - Call 1-800-898-7180 or visit the website
     - You will need your A-number (starts with “A” and has 9 digits)

## How to Prepare for Court

1. **Attend Every Hearing**  
   - Missing even one hearing can result in an automatic order of removal (deportation in your absence).

2. **Bring Important Documents**  
   - Identification (passport, ID)
   - Any prior immigration paperwork
   - Your NTA

3. **Tell the Judge if You Need Time to Find a Lawyer**  
   - You can request more time to find representation at your first hearing.

4. **Keep Your Address Updated with the Court**  
   - If you move, you must file Form EOIR-33 to update your address.
   - You can download it from: [justice.gov/eoir/eoir-forms](https://www.justice.gov/eoir/eoir-forms)

## Watch Out for These Mistakes

- **Ignoring the NTA**  
  → Leads to removal orders without a chance to speak in court.

- **Trusting unlicensed help**  
  → “Notarios” may give false hope or take your money without helping.

- **Thinking you don’t have options**  
  → Many people qualify for defenses, including asylum, cancellation of removal, or waivers.
