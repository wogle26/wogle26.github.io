Only U.S. **citizens** and **lawful permanent residents (green card holders)** can sponsor relatives for immigration. The sponsor must file a petition proving the relationship and take financial responsibility for the person.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **File Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative)**  
   - This form establishes your relationship with the family member  
   - Filing fee: $535  
   - Submit to USCIS with supporting documents

2. **Wait for Approval**  
   - Immediate relatives (spouses, minor children, parents of U.S. citizens) do **not** have to wait for a visa number  
   - Others must wait for a visa to become available based on the **Visa Bulletin**

3. **Your Family Member Applies for a Visa or Adjustment of Status**
   - If they’re **outside the U.S.**, they go through **consular processing** via the National Visa Center  
   - If they’re **inside the U.S.**, they may file Form I-485 (green card application), if eligible

4. **Attend Interviews and Submit Biometrics**
   - The U.S. government may require fingerprints, photos, and a formal interview

5. **Receive a Decision**
   - If approved, the family member receives a green card (permanent resident status)

## Documents to Submit with I-130

- Proof of your U.S. citizenship or green card (passport, naturalization certificate, or green card copy)
- Proof of relationship (birth certificates, marriage license, etc.)
- If sponsoring a spouse, additional evidence of a real marriage (photos, joint finances, lease, etc.)

## Understanding Priority Categories

Family-based immigration is divided into **preference categories**, which determine how long the wait is. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens (like spouses and parents) are not subject to quotas and usually have faster processing.

Use the [Visa Bulletin](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html) to check your category’s current wait time.
