## What Is Consular Processing?

Consular processing is the method used by individuals **outside the United States** to apply for an immigrant visa (green card). After USCIS approves a petition (like Form I-130), the case is transferred to the **National Visa Center (NVC)** and then to a U.S. consulate or embassy in the applicant’s home country.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **USCIS Approves the Immigrant Petition**
   - Usually Form I-130 (family) or I-140 (employment)

2. **Case Sent to National Visa Center (NVC)**
   - NVC assigns a case number  
   - You pay required fees and submit documents online via the **Consular Electronic Application Center (CEAC)**

3. **Submit Required Documents**
   - Affidavit of Support (Form I-864) from the sponsor  
   - Civil documents (birth certificate, police records, passport scans, etc.)

4. **Schedule a Visa Interview**
   - Once the case is “documentarily complete,” the embassy will schedule an interview

5. **Attend the Interview**
   - Bring originals of all documents  
   - You may be asked detailed questions about your background, finances, or relationship with the sponsor

6. **Medical Exam**
   - Required before the interview at a doctor authorized by the U.S. embassy

7. **Receive a Decision**
   - If approved, you’ll receive a visa and instructions to enter the U.S.  
   - You’ll receive your green card by mail after arrival
