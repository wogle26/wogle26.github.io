## What Is an RFE?

A Request for Evidence (RFE) is a notice from USCIS asking for additional documents or clarification before they can decide on your case. It means your case is not denied, but USCIS needs more information.

---

## Why You Might Receive an RFE

Common reasons include:
- Missing proof of a family relationship
- Incomplete signatures or blank fields
- Outdated or unclear documents
- Questions about your immigration history or eligibility

## Step-by-Step: How to Respond

1. **Read the RFE Carefully**
   - Note the deadline — usually **30 to 87 days**
   - Review each item USCIS is asking for

2. **Gather the Exact Documents Requested**
   - Be specific — send only what USCIS asked for  
   - Include certified translations if the documents are not in English

3. **Include the RFE Notice as a Cover Page**
   - Always send back the original RFE notice with your response  
   - This helps USCIS identify your case and match it correctly

4. **Make Copies of Everything**
   - Keep copies of your full response and the original RFE

5. **Mail It to the Address Listed**
   - Follow the mailing instructions exactly  
   - Use tracked mail (like USPS Priority Mail or UPS) to confirm delivery

## Tips

- Responding completely and on time can save your case  
- Do **not** send extra documents that were not requested  
- If you're unsure what to submit, speak with a licensed immigration attorney or accredited representative
