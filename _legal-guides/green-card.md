   There are different categories for applying, such as:
   - Family-based
   - Employment-based
   - Special immigrant
   - Asylum or refugee status

   Someone may need to file a petition for you (like Form I-130 or I-140), or you may self-petition.

   For some categories, there is a waiting list based on your country and case type.

5. **Attend Appointments and Interviews**  
   You may need to:
   - Attend a biometrics appointment
