Immigration processes often involve official letters and notices that can be confusing if you are unfamiliar with U.S. immigration procedures. These documents may come from USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services), EOIR (immigration court), or ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). Understanding what these notices mean — and what action, if any, you need to take — is critical to protecting your case and complying with legal requirements.

This guide covers the most common types of notices and how to respond to them.

## Notice to Appear (NTA)

A **Notice to Appear (NTA)** is a formal charging document from the Department of Homeland Security. It means the government is beginning **removal proceedings** against you.

Key facts:
- The NTA includes the reason the government believes you should be deported.
- It will list a hearing date and the location of immigration court (or say “To Be Determined”).
- You must attend your court hearings or you could receive a removal order in your absence.

You have the right to hire an attorney (at your own expense) to represent you in court. If the hearing date is missing or delayed, use the EOIR case status system to check your hearing details: [https://acis.eoir.justice.gov/en/](https://acis.eoir.justice.gov/en/)

## Request for Evidence (RFE)

A **Request for Evidence (RFE)** is sent by USCIS when your application is missing information or supporting documents.

Key facts:
- The RFE will list specific things USCIS needs (e.g., a birth certificate, tax forms, translations).
- You will have a deadline, usually 30–90 days, to send a response.
- If you miss the deadline, your application may be denied.

Include a cover letter, make copies of everything you send, and keep proof of mailing.

## Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID)

A **Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID)** means USCIS believes your application will be denied but is giving you a chance to respond.

Key facts:
- NOIDs often follow an RFE when USCIS still finds problems in your case.
- You must respond within the stated deadline (usually short — around 30 days).
- If you do not respond, the denial will be finalized.

Unlike RFEs, a NOID means your case is in serious jeopardy. Consider speaking to an attorney immediately.

## Appointment Notices (Form I-797)

USCIS uses **Form I-797** to send many types of notices:
- Biometrics appointments
- Interview scheduling
- Case receipt confirmations
- Approval or denial notices

Always read Form I-797 carefully. It contains your receipt number, the office handling your case, and important dates.

## Decision Notices

A **Decision Notice** tells you the result of your application:
- **Approval**: You may receive your document (e.g., green card, EAD) shortly after.
- **Denial**: USCIS will explain why and whether you can appeal or reapply.
- In court, the immigration judge may give a verbal decision or mail a written one.

Keep all decision notices in a safe place. You may need them to renew benefits, appeal a denial, or prove your status.

## Tips for Handling Immigration Notices

- **Keep your address updated.** File Form AR-11 with USCIS and notify EOIR separately if you move.
- **Check your case online.** Use [USCIS Case Status](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/) or [EOIR Case Status](https://acis.eoir.justice.gov/en/)
- **Open mail immediately.** Many notices are time-sensitive.
- **Make copies.** Keep both paper and digital versions of all correspondence.
- **Do not ignore deadlines.** Missing a response window can harm your case.

## Sample Envelope

Mail from USCIS usually comes in a white envelope with a government return address. EOIR court mail may have “U.S. Department of Justice” listed.

Do not assume it is junk mail. Open all correspondence carefully.
