If you are scheduled for an appointment at a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office, understanding what to expect can help reduce stress and ensure that you are fully prepared. This guide covers common types of USCIS appointments, how to check your appointment details, what to bring, and how to navigate the process respectfully and efficiently.

## Types of USCIS Appointments

There are several reasons why you might be scheduled to visit a USCIS field office:

- **Biometrics Appointment (ASC Appointment):** For fingerprinting, photos, and signatures. Usually required shortly after you submit an application (e.g., for a green card or work permit).
- **Adjustment of Status Interview:** In-person interview for green card applicants applying from within the U.S.
- **Naturalization Interview:** Interview and civics test for applicants seeking U.S. citizenship.
- **InfoPass Appointment:** Rare now, but may be used for urgent questions or case assistance (typically scheduled online in advance).

Check your appointment notice (Form I-797) to confirm the type of appointment and location.

## How to Prepare

- **Bring your appointment notice.** You must present this at check-in.
- **Bring valid photo identification.** Accepted forms include a passport, state ID, driver’s license, or work permit (EAD).
- **Arrive early.** It is recommended to arrive 15–30 minutes before your scheduled time.
- **Review your case.** If your appointment is an interview, review the forms and documents you submitted so you can answer questions clearly.
- **Dress appropriately.** Business casual attire is recommended.

If you need an interpreter or disability accommodation, follow the instructions on your appointment notice or contact USCIS in advance.

## At the Appointment

### 1. Security Checkpoint
All visitors go through a security screening. You may be asked to remove shoes, belts, and electronic devices. Weapons are strictly prohibited.

### 2. Check-In
Give your appointment notice and photo ID to the front desk. They will confirm your details and direct you to the appropriate waiting area.

### 3. Wait to Be Called
Wait times vary. Bring something to read, but keep phones on silent and be respectful of others.

### 4. The Appointment Itself
- For **biometrics**, you’ll be guided through fingerprinting, photographing, and signing your name.
- For **interviews**, an officer will ask questions about your application and may review your documents.
- You may be asked to confirm information or provide new supporting documents.

If your interview goes well, you may receive a decision on the spot — or a notice will be mailed later.

## Tips

- **Do not miss your appointment.** If you cannot attend, follow the instructions in your appointment notice to reschedule as early as possible.
- **Do not bring family members unless required.** Exceptions include interpreters (if allowed), legal representatives, or dependents on your application.
- **Do not sign anything you do not understand.** Ask for clarification or request an interpreter.

## After the Appointment

You may receive:
- A decision notice (approval, denial, or request for additional evidence)
- An oath ceremony notice (for naturalization)
- A follow-up appointment or interview
