Many immigrants in the United States interact with government agencies, legal offices, and public institutions without fluent English skills. U.S. law provides protections to ensure that language barriers do not prevent individuals from understanding or participating in important proceedings. This guide explains when and how you can request interpretation services, and what your rights are in key settings.

## When You Are Entitled to an Interpreter

Under federal law, most public institutions and government agencies that receive federal funding are required to provide language access services. These include:

- **USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services)**
- **EOIR (immigration court)**
- **ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)**
- **Hospitals and public clinics**
- **Schools, social services, and housing authorities**

Even if you are not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, you still have the right to understand and be understood in these contexts.

## USCIS Interpretation Guidelines

USCIS has specific rules depending on the appointment type:

- **Biometrics appointments:** Interpretation is usually not needed.
- **Interviews:** USCIS allows you to bring your own interpreter for most interviews (except asylum interviews).
- **Asylum interviews:** USCIS provides a government-contracted interpreter by telephone in most cases.

If you need interpretation:
- Bring a fluent adult interpreter (age 18+), who is not your attorney or a witness.
- That person must complete Form G-1256 (Declaration for Interpreters).

Always check the latest USCIS policy, as interpretation rules can change.

## Immigration Court Interpretation

If you have a hearing before an immigration judge and do not speak English fluently, **the court must provide a qualified interpreter at no cost to you**.

- You do not need to request one in advance — the court will arrange it based on your language listed in your file.
- You should notify the court or your attorney if the interpreter speaks the wrong dialect or you cannot understand them.

You have the right to understand everything that is said in court. If you are confused, respectfully tell the judge or your attorney.

## Hospitals and Emergency Services

Under the Civil Rights Act (Title VI), hospitals and public health clinics that receive federal funds must provide:

- Qualified medical interpreters (in-person or by phone)
- Translated consent forms and discharge instructions
- Language access signage and help desks

You should never be forced to rely on a child or family member to interpret for medical decisions.

## How to Request an Interpreter

If you are unsure whether an interpreter will be available:

1. **Call the agency in advance.**
2. **State your preferred language clearly.**
3. **Ask for confirmation that language assistance will be provided.**

Most agencies have staff or phone systems with multilingual prompts. You can also bring a printed card that says, “I speak [language]. I need an interpreter,” in English and your language.

## Common Challenges and How to Respond

| Situation | What You Can Do |
|----------|------------------|
| You don’t understand the interpreter | Politely inform the officer or judge |
| No interpreter is present | Ask to reschedule or request one immediately |
| You are asked to sign a form you can’t read | Do not sign — ask for a translation or interpreter |
| You're told to bring your own interpreter | Confirm whether this is required or optional under agency rules |
