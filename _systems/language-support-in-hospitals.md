Access to clear communication in medical and public service settings is essential — especially when your health, safety, or legal obligations are involved. In the United States, people who do not speak English fluently still have the right to understand and be understood in these environments. This guide explains when government agencies and healthcare providers must offer language services, what those services include, and how to request them.

## Your Right to Language Access

Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, any organization that receives federal funding must take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access for people with limited English proficiency (LEP). This includes:

- **Hospitals and emergency rooms**
- **Public health clinics**
- **Social service agencies (SNAP, housing, child welfare)**
- **Public schools**
- **Courts and probation departments**
- **Police and first responders**

These entities are not allowed to deny services or make you bring your own interpreter.

## What Services Must Be Provided

Depending on the agency or provider, language access may include:

- **In-person interpreters**
- **Phone or video interpretation services**
- **Translated written documents**
- **Bilingual staff at intake or front desks**

For example:
- Hospitals often contract with phone interpretation companies that can connect you to a qualified interpreter in minutes.
- Public benefits offices must provide translated forms and help you complete them.
- Public schools must provide interpretation at meetings and translate important notices for parents or guardians.

## How to Ask for Language Help

You have the right to ask for language assistance at any point. Here’s how:

- Say: “I need an interpreter in [your language].”
- Bring a printed language ID card (e.g., “I speak [language] — please provide an interpreter.”)
- Point to translated signs or posters (many offices display multilingual posters listing available languages)

If the staff refuses, ask to speak to a supervisor or refer to the agency’s language access plan, which is often available online.

## Common Issues and What to Do

| Situation | What You Can Do |
|----------|------------------|
| No interpreter is offered | Ask clearly in English for one; use a card or bring a phrase in writing |
| Asked to bring your own interpreter | Politely refuse if it's a child or unqualified person — you are entitled to a professional |
| Documents are not translated | Request them or ask the staff to read them aloud with an interpreter |
| Miscommunication leads to confusion | Ask for clarification, or request a different interpreter if necessary |

You do not have to sign forms or consent to services you do not understand.

## Special Protections in Medical Settings

In hospitals and clinics:

- **You should never be forced to use a child or family member as an interpreter.**
- **You have the right to understand diagnosis, treatment options, and discharge instructions.**
- **If communication is unclear, it is okay to pause the visit and request a better solution.**

All major hospitals are required to follow federal guidelines on language access and risk losing funding if they fail to comply.
