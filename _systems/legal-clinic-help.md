If you are seeking legal help for an immigration issue and cannot afford a private attorney, nonprofit legal clinics may be able to assist. These organizations offer free or low-cost services and often focus on helping immigrants with limited income or language access. This page explains what legal clinics do, how to prepare for your visit, and what to expect from the experience.

## What Legal Clinics Can Help With

Most nonprofit immigration legal aid clinics assist with:

- Applications for asylum, green cards, or work permits
- DACA renewals or TPS (Temporary Protected Status)
- Family petitions (e.g., I-130)
- Removal defense or court filings
- Requests for fee waivers
- General legal consultations

Some clinics also offer help with housing, employment, or public benefits — but only a trained immigration attorney or accredited representative can handle immigration law matters.

## What Legal Clinics Cannot Do

Legal aid organizations are limited in what they can offer:

- They **cannot represent everyone** — many have waitlists or strict eligibility criteria.
- They **cannot guarantee outcomes** — even if they assist with a case.
- They **cannot give legal advice over the phone** unless you are an established client.
- They **do not handle criminal cases** or lawsuits unrelated to immigration.

If your case is complex or urgent, they may refer you to another organization or suggest hiring a private attorney if possible.

## How to Find a Legal Clinic

- Use trusted directories like [immigrationadvocates.org](https://www.immigrationadvocates.org/nonprofit/legaldirectory/)
- Look for services offered in your language
- Ask whether the organization is recognized by the Department of Justice (DOJ)

Your local area may also have clinics through:
- Law schools
- Churches or community centers
- National organizations like Catholic Charities or RAICES

Be cautious of “notarios” or immigration consultants who are not licensed or accredited.

## How to Prepare for Your Visit

To make the most of your appointment:

- **Bring all immigration documents**, such as passports, USCIS notices, court paperwork, applications, or denials.
- **Bring identification** for yourself and any family members related to your case.
- **Make a list of questions** ahead of time.
- **Know your timeline** — bring any documents that show deadlines or hearing dates.
- **Bring a trusted interpreter** if the clinic does not offer one and you need help communicating.

Arrive on time and expect to wait, especially if the clinic is walk-in based.

## What to Expect During the Appointment

- You may first speak with a volunteer or staff member to review your documents.
- A lawyer or accredited representative will then meet with you to evaluate your case.
- You may receive:
  - General legal advice
  - Help filling out forms
  - A referral to another organization
  - A follow-up appointment or representation offer

Some clinics offer one-time consultations, while others may take you on as a client.

## Tips

- Be honest and complete when discussing your case — withholding information can cause serious problems.
- Respect time limits. Many consultations are brief.
- Take notes or ask for a written summary if you’re unclear on next steps.
