## Why It Matters

Your hearing in immigration court is a legal proceeding. Failing to prepare — or missing the hearing — can lead to serious consequences, including a removal order issued in your absence.

---

## What to Bring

- Your **Notice to Appear (NTA)**
- Any **documents filed with the court**
- A valid **photo ID**
- Proof of residence or financial documents (if relevant)
- Any evidence supporting your case (originals and copies)

---

## Know the Type of Hearing

- **Master Calendar Hearing** (short, procedural):
  - You’ll confirm your personal info and charges
  - You may request time to find a lawyer
  - You do **not** present your full case here

- **Individual Hearing** (full case hearing):
  - You’ll present all your evidence and testimony
  - You must bring witnesses, translators, and paperwork
  - The judge will issue a decision or schedule another hearing

---

## If You Need More Time

At your first hearing, you can ask the judge for a **continuance** to find a lawyer or prepare documents. Show that you're making efforts to get legal help.

---

## If You Move Before Your Hearing

You must file **Form EOIR-33** with the court and send a copy to the government attorney (ICE Office of Chief Counsel).  
Failure to update your address can result in missing critical notices.

## What to Wear

Treat the hearing like any other court appointment. Wear neat, clean, conservative clothing. Avoid casual attire like shorts, flip-flops, or slogans on T-shirts.
