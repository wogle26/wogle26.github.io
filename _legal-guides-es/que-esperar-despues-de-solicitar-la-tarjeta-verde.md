## Overview

After filing your green card application (Form I-485 or consular processing through the NVC), several steps may follow before a final decision is made. Timelines and requirements vary depending on your category and background.

---

## Common Steps After Applying

1. **Receipt Notice (Form I-797C)**
   - Confirms that USCIS received your application
   - Includes your receipt number to track your case

2. **Biometrics Appointment**
   - USCIS will send a notice with a date, time, and location to take your fingerprints and photo

3. **Request for Evidence (RFE)**
   - If something is missing or unclear, USCIS may ask for more documents
   - Respond by the deadline given (usually 30–87 days)

4. **Interview Notice**
   - Most applicants must attend an interview at a USCIS office
   - Bring originals of all key documents and any updates since you filed

5. **Final Decision**
   - USCIS will mail your green card if approved
   - If denied, the letter will explain why and whether you can appeal
