## Why Check Your Case Status?

If you’ve submitted a petition, application, or been placed into immigration court proceedings, it’s important to track your case regularly. You may receive hearing notices, deadlines, or other updates — and missing one could harm your case.

---

## Option 1: If Your Case Is with USCIS

This applies to most immigration forms like:
- Green card applications (I-485)
- Work permits (I-765)
- Family petitions (I-130)
- Naturalization (N-400)
- Asylum applications (I-589, if not in court yet)

### How to Check:
1. Go to: [uscis.gov/casestatus](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/)
2. Enter your 13-character receipt number (example: EAC1234567890)
   - This is found on your receipt notice (Form I-797C)

### What You'll See:
- “Case Was Received”
- “Fingerprint Fee Was Received”
- “Case Was Approved”
- “RFE Was Sent” (Request for Evidence)
- “Card Was Mailed”

Each status will include a brief explanation.

## Option 2: If You Are in Immigration Court

This applies if you’ve received a Notice to Appear (NTA) or are facing removal proceedings.

### How to Check:
1. Call the EOIR Case Status Hotline:  
   📞 **1-800-898-7180** (toll-free, 24/7)  
   OR  
   Visit: [acis.eoir.justice.gov](https://acis.eoir.justice.gov/en/)

2. Enter your A-number (starts with “A” and has 9 digits)

### What You'll See:
- Your next hearing date and time
- Location of the court
- Type of proceeding (master calendar or individual hearing)
- Current status (pending, ordered removed, granted relief, etc.)

---

## What If You See No Updates?

- If USCIS: Make sure your receipt number is correct and hasn’t expired
- If EOIR: You may not be scheduled yet — check back weekly
- Always make sure your **mailing address is current** with USCIS or the court

To update your address:
- USCIS: [uscis.gov/addresschange](https://www.uscis.gov/addresschange)
- EOIR: Submit Form EOIR-33 to your local immigration court

---

## Watch Out for These Issues

- **Wrong site** — Don’t check USCIS if your case is in court (EOIR), and vice versa
- **Scams** — Only check your status through official government websites
- **Old receipt numbers** — Cases that are over 2 years old may no longer update online
