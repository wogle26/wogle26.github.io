A **public charge** is a person who the U.S. government believes is likely to rely primarily on certain government benefits for support. This concept can be used to deny entry into the U.S. or deny a green card (lawful permanent resident status).

## When Does the Public Charge Rule Apply?

It typically applies when someone is:

- Applying for a green card from within the U.S. (Adjustment of Status)
- Applying for a visa or green card from abroad

It **does not apply** to:

- Asylum or refugee applicants
- Certain special categories like U visa, T visa, or VAWA applicants
- Most lawful permanent residents renewing a green card

## What Benefits Are Considered?

Currently, the public charge rule considers:

- **Cash assistance** (such as SSI or TANF)
- **Long-term institutional care at government expense**

**It does not** consider benefits like Medicaid (except in certain circumstances), SNAP (food stamps), public housing, or WIC.

## What Does USCIS Evaluate?

USCIS looks at factors such as:

- Age
- Health
- Family status
- Financial resources
- Education and skills
- Whether you have an affidavit of support (Form I-864)
