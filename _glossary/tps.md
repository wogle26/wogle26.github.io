**Temporary Protected Status (TPS)** is a form of immigration relief granted to individuals from certain countries experiencing dangerous or unstable conditions that make it unsafe to return. It allows recipients to live and work legally in the United States for a temporary period.

## Who Qualifies for TPS?

The U.S. government (specifically the Department of Homeland Security) designates which countries qualify for TPS. Reasons for designation can include:

- Ongoing armed conflict (e.g., civil war)
- Natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes or hurricanes)
- Other extraordinary conditions (e.g., environmental or public health crises)

To be eligible, an individual must:

- Be a national of a TPS-designated country (or a person with no nationality who last habitually resided in that country)
- File during the open registration or re-registration period
- Have been continuously present in the U.S. since the date specified in the country’s TPS designation
- Not have disqualifying criminal convictions or immigration violations

## What Does TPS Provide?

TPS allows you to:

- Live and work legally in the United States during the designated period
- Receive protection from deportation
- Apply for a travel permit (advance parole)

TPS does **not** lead to a green card or citizenship by itself, but it doesn’t prevent you from applying for other immigration benefits you may be eligible for.

## How to Apply

You must submit:

- **Form I-821** (Application for Temporary Protected Status)
- **Form I-765** (Application for Employment Authorization), if you want to work
- Supporting documents that prove your identity, nationality, and presence in the U.S.

You must also pay the required fees or request a fee waiver.
