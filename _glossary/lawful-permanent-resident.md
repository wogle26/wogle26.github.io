A **Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR)** is a person who has been officially granted the right to live and work in the United States indefinitely. This status is proven by a **Green Card**.

## What Rights Do LPRs Have?

LPRs can:

- Live permanently in the U.S.
- Work for most U.S. employers
- Travel abroad (though long trips can risk abandonment of status)
- Sponsor some family members for Green Cards
- Apply for U.S. citizenship after a waiting period (usually 5 years)

LPRs are also protected under most U.S. laws and must follow the same legal obligations as citizens, including paying taxes.

## What LPRs Cannot Do

Unlike U.S. citizens, LPRs:

- Cannot vote in federal elections
- Can lose status if they commit certain crimes or violate immigration laws
- Must renew their Green Card every 10 years
- Must notify USCIS of any address change within 10 days

## How to Become a Lawful Permanent Resident

Most people become LPRs by:

- Receiving a **Green Card** through family or employer sponsorship
- Being granted asylum or refugee status and applying after 1 year
- Qualifying under special categories (e.g., Diversity Visa Lottery, U visa holders)

## Maintaining Your Status

To avoid losing your status, you must:

- Not stay outside the U.S. for long periods without a reentry permit
- Avoid serious criminal convictions
- Not claim to be a U.S. citizen unless naturalized
