**Bond** is a payment that allows someone in immigration detention to be temporarily released while their immigration case is ongoing. It serves as a guarantee that the person will show up to future court hearings.

## When Is Bond Available?

Not everyone qualifies for bond. You **may be eligible** if:

- You are **not subject to mandatory detention** (for certain crimes or security concerns)
- You can show that you are **not a danger to the community**
- You can prove that you are **not a flight risk** (i.e., you’re likely to appear in court)

A judge will decide whether to grant bond and how much it will be.

## How Much Does Bond Cost?

- The **minimum** bond is usually **$1,500**, but it can be much higher.
- Some people pay over $10,000 depending on their case.
- The bond must be paid in full to ICE by a **U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident**.

Once paid, the person can be released from detention.

## Can Bond Be Refunded?

Yes — if the person attends all their immigration court hearings and complies with the process, the bond money can be refunded after the case is over. If they miss court, the bond is **forfeited**.
