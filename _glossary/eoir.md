The **Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR)** is a part of the U.S. Department of Justice. It is responsible for overseeing the immigration court system in the United States.

## What Does EOIR Do?

EOIR runs two main types of immigration proceedings:

- **Master Calendar Hearings**: Short scheduling hearings where cases are introduced and future court dates are set.
- **Individual Hearings**: Longer sessions where the judge hears evidence and makes a decision on whether someone can remain in the U.S.

EOIR also manages:

- **Immigration judges** who decide cases.
- **The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)**, which handles appeals of immigration judge decisions.

EOIR does **not** handle immigration benefits like green cards or work permits. Those are handled by **USCIS**, a different agency.

## Why Does EOIR Matter?

If you are in **removal proceedings**, your case will go through EOIR’s court system. This includes hearings before an immigration judge and possible appeals.

You will likely receive paperwork from EOIR, such as a **Notice to Appear (NTA)** or hearing notices. It’s very important to follow instructions from EOIR and attend all scheduled court dates.
