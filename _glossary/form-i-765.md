## What Is a Work Permit?

- TPS holders
- Applicants for adjustment of status (Form I-485)
- Certain student visa holders (F-1, M-1)
- U visa or VAWA applicants

## Key Details

- You can apply for Form I-765 together with Form I-485 or other immigration forms
- Processing time varies but usually takes a few **months**
