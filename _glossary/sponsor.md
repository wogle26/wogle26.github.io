A **sponsor** is a person—usually a U.S. citizen or green card holder—who agrees to take financial responsibility for someone applying for certain immigration benefits. Sponsorship helps show the U.S. government that the immigrant will not become a “public charge,” meaning someone who relies on government aid.

## When Is a Sponsor Required?

A sponsor is typically needed when someone is applying for:

- A **family-based green card** (e.g. spouse, parent, or child of a U.S. citizen or permanent resident)
- Some **employment-based green cards**
- Certain visas or parole programs (such as humanitarian parole)

## Sponsor Responsibilities

The sponsor must:

- File **Form I-864, Affidavit of Support**, promising to support the immigrant financially
- Show income that is at least **125% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines**
- Provide **financial support** if needed, until the immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen or earns enough work credits (usually 10 years)

This is a **legally binding agreement**. If the immigrant receives certain types of government assistance, the sponsor may be asked to repay the government.

## Joint Sponsors

If the main sponsor doesn’t meet the income requirements, a **joint sponsor** can help. They must file a separate I-864 and meet the same financial criteria.
