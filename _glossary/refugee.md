**Refugee** is a legal status for a person who is outside their home country and cannot return due to a well-founded fear of persecution.

## How Is Refugee Status Different from Asylum?

- **Location:** Refugees apply from **outside** the United States, usually through the United Nations or a U.S. embassy. Asylum is for people who are already **inside** the U.S. or at a port of entry.
- **Process:** Refugees go through screening and interviews abroad before traveling to the U.S.
- **Numbers:** The U.S. government sets an annual cap on how many refugees it will accept each year.

## What Qualifies Someone as a Refugee?

To qualify, a person must show they have been persecuted or fear future persecution because of:

- **Race**
- **Religion**
- **Nationality**
- **Political opinion**
- **Membership in a particular social group**

They must also prove that their home countryâ€™s government is unable or unwilling to protect them.

## Rights of Refugees in the U.S.

Once admitted, refugees:

- Can live and work legally in the U.S.
- May apply for a green card after **1 year**
- May apply for U.S. citizenship after **5 years**
- Can apply to bring certain family members
