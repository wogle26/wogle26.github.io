**U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)** is the government agency that processes most immigration applications and petitions in the United States. It is part of the **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**.

## What Does USCIS Do?

USCIS handles the **civil (non-criminal)** side of immigration. This includes:

- Green card applications (Form I-485)
- Work permits (Form I-765)
- Asylum applications (Form I-589, when not in court)
- Family petitions (Form I-130)
- Naturalization (becoming a U.S. citizen)
- DACA, TPS, and humanitarian protections

Unlike EOIR, USCIS does **not** run immigration courts or deport people. It makes decisions on whether to approve or deny your immigration request.

## How Do You Interact with USCIS?

You may send forms and documents by mail or submit online. After applying, USCIS may:

- Send you a **Receipt Notice**
- Request more information (called an **RFE**)
- Schedule an appointment for **biometrics**
- Send a final decision

You can check your case status online using the receipt number found on your notices.
