A **Green Card**, officially known as a **Permanent Resident Card**, allows someone to live and work permanently in the United States. It proves that the holder is a **Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR)**.

## What Does a Green Card Do?

With a Green Card, you can:

- Live anywhere in the U.S.
- Work legally for almost any employer
- Travel in and out of the country (though extended trips can affect your status)
- Apply to become a U.S. citizen after a certain number of years (usually 5)

You must **carry your Green Card** with you at all times and **renew it every 10 years**.

## How Do People Get a Green Card?

Common paths to getting a Green Card include:

- **Family sponsorship** (e.g., spouse, parent, or child of a U.S. citizen or LPR)
- **Employment-based immigration**
- **Asylum or refugee status** (after 1 year of being granted)
- **Special immigrant categories**, like victims of crime or abuse
- **Diversity Visa Lottery**

## Conditions and Responsibilities

Some Green Cards are **conditional**, such as those based on recent marriage. These must be converted to permanent status after 2 years.

As a Green Card holder, you must:

- Pay U.S. taxes
- Follow U.S. laws
- Avoid certain crimes or long trips abroad, which could lead to losing your status
