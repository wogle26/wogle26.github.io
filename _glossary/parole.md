**Parole** is a special permission that allows someone to enter or remain in the United States temporarily without being formally admitted. It is not a visa or a legal status, but it may allow the person to stay lawfully for a limited time.

## When Is Parole Used?

Parole is granted in specific situations, such as:

- **Humanitarian reasons**, like urgent medical treatment or family reunification
- **Public interest**, such as assisting in a criminal investigation
- **Military parole in place**, for close family members of active-duty U.S. military personnel
- **Special programs**, such as:
  - **Cuban Family Reunification Program**
  - **Ukrainian or Afghan humanitarian parole**
  - **Parole under the CAM program** (Central American Minors)

## What Does Parole Allow?

A person granted parole can:

- Enter or remain in the U.S. for a temporary, specified period
- Apply for a work permit (Form I-765)
- Sometimes apply for adjustment of status later (depending on eligibility and type of parole)

However, parole **does not**:

- Count as a formal "admission" to the U.S.
- Guarantee future immigration benefits
- Protect from removal after the parole expires

## How Do You Apply?

The application depends on the type of parole:

- Most humanitarian parole requests are submitted using **Form I-131**
- Supporting documentation must show the urgent need and identity
- Decisions are discretionary and not guaranteed
