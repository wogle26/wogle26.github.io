An **accredited representative** is a non-attorney who is authorized by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to represent individuals in immigration legal matters.

## What Do They Do?

Accredited representatives can:

- Provide **legal advice** on immigration matters
- Help you complete immigration forms
- Represent you in **immigration court** (if fully accredited)
- Attend interviews with immigration authorities (like USCIS)

They must work for a **recognized nonprofit organization** and cannot charge high legal fees.

## Types of Accreditation

- **Partial Accreditation**: Can represent individuals before **USCIS** and **other immigration agencies**, but not in court.
- **Full Accreditation**: Can also represent individuals in **immigration court (EOIR)**.

## Why Use One?

They offer **affordable** or **free** legal help, especially for low-income individuals. This makes legal services more accessible for immigrants who cannot afford a private attorney.

## How to Verify

- Accredited representatives are listed in the **DOJâ€™s official registry**
- You can check the list here: [EOIR Recognized Organizations and Accredited Representatives](https://www.justice.gov/eoir/recognition-accreditation-roster-reports)
