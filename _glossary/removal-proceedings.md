**Removal proceedings** are legal processes in which the U.S. government tries to deport (remove) a person from the country.

## Who Is Placed in Removal Proceedings?

- People who enter the U.S. without permission
- Visa holders who overstay or violate terms of their stay
- Green card holders with certain criminal convictions
- Asylum seekers whose claims are denied or referred to court

The process starts when someone receives a **Notice to Appear (NTA)** in immigration court.

## What Happens in Immigration Court?

1. **Master Calendar Hearing (MCH):** A short, first hearing where the judge confirms basic facts and sets deadlines.
2. **Merits Hearing:** A full hearing where the person and their attorney (if they have one) present evidence and arguments. A government lawyer also presents a case for removal.
3. **Judgeâ€™s Decision:** The judge decides whether the person will be removed or allowed to stay under a legal defense (like asylum or cancellation of removal).

## Rights During Proceedings

- You have the **right to an attorney**, but at your own expense.
- You can present evidence and call witnesses.
- You can appeal the decision to the **Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)**.
