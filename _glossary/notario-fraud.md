**Notario fraud** refers to the practice of individuals—often calling themselves “notarios” or “immigration consultants”—illegally providing legal services without a license, often targeting immigrant communities.

## Why Is It a Problem?

In many Latin American countries, a *notario público* is a licensed legal professional. But in the U.S., a **notary public** is not a lawyer and cannot give legal advice.

Some people exploit this confusion to:

- Pretend they are lawyers
- Charge high fees for services they are not qualified to provide
- Submit incorrect or fraudulent paperwork that can **harm your immigration case**

## Warning Signs

- Guarantees of getting a green card or visa
- Asking for cash with no receipt
- Refusing to provide a written contract
- Telling you to sign blank or incomplete forms
- Filing applications without your consent

## What to Do

- Always use an **accredited representative** or a **licensed immigration attorney**
- Report notario fraud to:
  - Your state attorney general
  - The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
  - EOIR’s fraud prevention unit
