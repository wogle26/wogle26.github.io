**Undocumented** refers to people living in the United States without current legal immigration status. This can include individuals who:

- Entered the U.S. without inspection (such as crossing the border unlawfully), or
- Entered legally (with a visa) but overstayed or violated the terms of their stay.

Being undocumented does **not** make a person a criminal, and the term "illegal immigrant" is often considered offensive or misleading. “Undocumented” is more accurate and respectful.

## Common Reasons People Are Undocumented

- Fleeing danger or poverty without a legal pathway to enter
- Waiting for visa or asylum processing and falling out of status
- Coming as children and never receiving legal status (such as many DACA recipients)

## Risks and Limitations

Undocumented individuals may:

- Be at risk of deportation
- Face limited access to healthcare, legal work, and financial aid
- Be ineligible for most federal public benefits

However, undocumented people **still have rights** under U.S. law, including:

- The right to emergency medical care
- The right to attend public school
- Certain protections under the Constitution (such as due process and freedom from unlawful searches)

## Pathways to Legalization

In some cases, undocumented individuals may become eligible for legal status through:

- Family petitions
- Asylum
- U visas (for victims of crimes)
- Special immigration legislation (like DACA or TPS)
