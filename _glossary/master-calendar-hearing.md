A **Master Calendar Hearing (MCH)** is a preliminary immigration court hearing where the judge schedules and manages the case. It is not the final decision on whether someone will be deported or allowed to stay in the U.S.

## What Happens at a Master Calendar Hearing?

During an MCH:

- The judge verifies your **identity and address**
- You confirm whether you **received the Notice to Appear (NTA)**
- You may be asked to **respond to the charges** in the NTA
- You tell the court whether you plan to apply for **any form of relief** (such as asylum)
- The judge sets **deadlines** and schedules your **Individual Hearing**

These hearings are usually short and are often held with **multiple people** in the courtroom at once.

## Do You Need a Lawyer?

You have the **right to an attorney**, but the government will **not provide one**. If you don’t have a lawyer, you can ask the judge for more time to find one.

## What Should You Bring?

- A copy of your NTA
- Any legal paperwork already filed
- The name and contact information of your attorney, if you have one
