**Work Authorization**, also known as an **Employment Authorization Document (EAD)**, is official permission from the U.S. government that allows non-citizens to legally work in the United States.

## Who Can Apply?

You may be eligible to apply for work authorization if you:

- Are applying for asylum or already have asylum
- Have Temporary Protected Status (TPS)
- Are a DACA recipient
- Are applying for adjustment of status (a green card)
- Have certain visas (like U or T visas for victims of crime or trafficking)

## How Do You Apply?

You must submit **Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization)** to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). You may need to include:

- Proof of eligibility (such as pending asylum application)
- Identity documents
- Passport photos
- Filing fee or a fee waiver request

## What Does It Look Like?

If approved, you will receive a plastic card with your photo that shows the dates during which you are allowed to work legally. This card is often referred to as an **EAD card**.

## Important Notes

- Work authorization is usually **temporary** and must be **renewed**.
- Working without authorization can have serious immigration consequences.
- If your immigration status changes, your work eligibility may also change.
