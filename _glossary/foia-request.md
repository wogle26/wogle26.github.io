A **FOIA request** is a written request for information under the **Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)**, a federal law that allows the public to access records from U.S. government agencies.

## Why Make a FOIA Request?

In immigration cases, a FOIA request is often used to:

- Get a copy of your **immigration file (A-file)**
- Check past **immigration history** or interactions with government agencies
- Understand the evidence in a deportation or removal case
- Gather documents to support an asylum or green card application

## What Agencies Handle FOIA Requests?

You can file a FOIA request with different agencies depending on what you need:

- **USCIS** – for your A-file and immigration applications
- **ICE** – for detention and enforcement records
- **CBP** – for records about border entries or encounters
- **EOIR** – for court records and decisions

## How to File

- You can submit a FOIA request **online or by mail**
- It’s **free**, but responses can take several **weeks or months**
- Be specific in what you're requesting (for example: “entire A-file”)
