**Biometrics** are physical characteristics used to identify a person. In the immigration process, biometrics usually include:

- **Fingerprints**
- **Photograph**
- **Signature**

USCIS uses biometrics to conduct background checks and confirm a person’s identity.

## When Are Biometrics Required?

You may be required to attend a **biometrics appointment** (often called an ASC appointment) after submitting applications such as:

- Form I-485 (Green Card)
- Form I-765 (Work Authorization)
- Form I-131 (Advance Parole)

The appointment is typically scheduled at an **Application Support Center (ASC)**.

## What Happens at the Appointment?

At your appointment, you will:

- Provide fingerprints, a photo, and your signature
- Present government-issued ID
- Receive a confirmation receipt

The appointment is **not an interview**, and you won’t be asked questions about your immigration case.
