**DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals)** is a program that protects certain undocumented individuals who came to the United States as children. It does not provide legal status, but it offers protection from deportation and allows recipients to apply for work authorization.

## Who Qualifies for DACA?

To be eligible for DACA, an individual must have:

- Arrived in the U.S. before turning 16
- Continuously resided in the U.S. since June 15, 2007
- Been under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012
- Been physically present in the U.S. on June 15, 2012, and at the time of applying
- Entered the U.S. without inspection before June 15, 2012, or had lawful status that expired before that date
- Be currently in school, have graduated or obtained a GED, or have been honorably discharged from the military
- Not have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or more than three misdemeanors

## What Does DACA Provide?

DACA allows recipients to:

- Stay in the U.S. temporarily without fear of deportation
- Apply for work authorization (valid for 2 years at a time)
- Get a Social Security number
- In some states, apply for a driver's license or in-state tuition

DACA does **not** provide a path to permanent residency or citizenship, and its future is subject to ongoing legal challenges.

## How to Apply

You must submit:

- **Form I-821D** (Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals)
- **Form I-765** (Application for Employment Authorization)
- **Form I-765WS** (Worksheet explaining economic need)
- Supporting documents showing identity, continuous residence, education, and eligibility

You must also pay the required fees unless you qualify for a very limited fee exemption.
