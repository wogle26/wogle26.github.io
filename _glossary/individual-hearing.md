An **Individual Hearing** is a formal court proceeding in immigration court where a judge decides whether a person can remain in the United States or must be removed (deported).

Unlike a Master Calendar Hearing, which is short and procedural, an Individual Hearing is longer and more detailed. It is your main opportunity to present your **asylum claim** or other defenses against removal.

## What Happens During an Individual Hearing?

- The **immigration judge** hears testimony from the immigrant (called the “respondent”) and any witnesses.
- The government attorney may ask questions or challenge the evidence.
- You can present **documents, affidavits, or expert reports** in support of your case.
- You may testify about your experiences, reasons for seeking protection, and any hardships you or your family would face if deported.

At the end of the hearing, the judge may issue a decision or schedule another hearing. If the judge rules against you, you may have the right to **appeal**.

## How to Prepare

- Bring **all required documents** and forms.
- Dress professionally and arrive early.
- If needed, request a **court interpreter** in your language.
- If possible, have a **lawyer or accredited representative** present to help argue your case.
