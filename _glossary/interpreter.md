An **interpreter** is someone who translates spoken language from one language to another to help people understand each other. In immigration settings, interpreters are often used to help applicants who do not speak English communicate during interviews, hearings, or when receiving services.

## When Might You Need an Interpreter?

You may need an interpreter for:

- **USCIS interviews** (such as asylum or green card interviews)
- **Immigration court hearings**
- **Meetings with immigration lawyers or legal aid providers**

## Who Can Serve as an Interpreter?

Requirements vary depending on the setting:

- **USCIS interviews**: Often, you must bring your own interpreter. They must be fluent in both languages and not be your attorney or a witness in your case.
- **Immigration court**: Courts typically provide a government-paid interpreter for most languages.
- **Legal aid or clinics**: Some organizations provide interpreters; others may ask you to bring one.

## Interpreter vs. Translator

An **interpreter** deals with spoken language. A **translator** works with written documents. They are different roles, though both are important in legal and immigration contexts.
